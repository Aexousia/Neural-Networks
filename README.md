# Neural-Networks

This repository consists the code for a basic neural network, that can be used for the any purpose with a little tweaking 
it also includes the famous MNSIT dataset with an data expander using the basic process of image alteration.

The Neural Network uses the Quadratic Cost function and Stochastic gradient descent with no regularization.

#  Running tests

To check that the Neural network is running without any error follow the instructions in test.py

# New Features to be added

The project contains the additional cost functions in the costfunctions.py they can impletmented in the project , further the concepts of 
Regularization and Data Visualisation and enchancing the performance through little tweaks which will be discussed further are to be implemented.

# What is a Neural Network

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
